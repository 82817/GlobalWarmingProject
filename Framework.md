## Climate change caused by human activity


[Based on this article by Harvard Business Review](https://hbr.org/2013/04/the-three-elements-of-successf), there are three elements that make up a sucessful data visualization. First, it understands the audience. Second, it sets up a clear framework. Third, it tells a story. I agree with this idea because it reinforces with effective components that was introduced in class, which is audience, argument, and chart. By using this information, I will build my framework based on the following:

1. Audience: Who is the audience of this graph? First identify the audience and see if the graph is appropriate for the reader based on the information presented. It is also critical to evaluate how the information is being presented. 

2. Framekwork (chart): Is the graph easy to understand? Are the syntax and labels appropriate for the information? Does it fill in any information that the audience might need in order to interpret this graph? Understandability will be important in this part.

3. Story (argument): Does the visualization tell a story? Does it enable the reader to understand the purpose of this visualization and the message its trying to convey?

I believe a good visualization should do a good job in all three criterias; however, not all visualizations are good and I will explain the good/bad of each chart.

![Temperature & Carbon Dioxide](https://github.com/82817/GlobalWarmingProject/blob/master/images/1_global_temperature_carbon_dioxide.jpg)


**Audience**: This visualization is made by Climate Central, an independent organization researching and reporting facts about climate change. It is safe to assume that the designer want to present factual information to the general public. It contains simple information and does a good job at addressing to its audience. One improvment I would add is to explain what PPM is. One can assume that this is the metric for carbon dioxide, but without previous knowledge for carbon dioxide, it leaves ambiguity. (0.5/1)

**Framekwork**: All axis are properly marked and spaced with the left Y-axis indicating temperature and right Y-axis indicate carbon dioxide level. There is also a good color contrast between the two variables. (1/1)

**Story**: I believe this visualization does a good job at presenting the information in a neutral way. It leads audience to believe there is a high correlation between the two variables. Carbon dioxide came from burning of fossil fuels burned by human. It raises awareness and make the audience question whether the usage of carbon dioxide causes temperature to rise. (1/1)

Score: (2.5/3)

![Hottest Years](https://github.com/82817/GlobalWarmingProject/blob/master/images/2_hottest_years.jpg)


**Audience**: Again, this visualization is made by Climate Central. We can infer that this chart should be simple and is made for the general public. The information is indeed simple and straightforward. (1/1)

**framework**: The axis are clearly labeled and nicely spaced. I'm assuming the bar for 2018 is white to represent the current year the visualization is made. (1/1)

**Story**: I like how it says "Last 5 = Hottest 5" on top. It points out something the reader might not notice if they didn't read the x-axis closely. For me, this also points out the time-sensitive nature of global warming. (1/1)

Score: (3/3)

![Current CO2 Level](https://github.com/82817/GlobalWarmingProject/blob/master/images/3_co2_level.jpg)


**Audience**: This visualization is made by NASA and is meant for the general public. It is meant to educate the audience by presenting factual information that is easy to understand. (1/1)

**framework**: The data goes 400,000 years back but it does a good job at sclaing the data and presenting the proportions. The background and the data creates a nice contrast. (1/1)

**Story**: I like the line in the middle where it says "For 650,000 years, atmospheric CO2 has never been above this line... until now". This message not only portrays the message of this visual, but it is also part of the visual that act as a threshold. (1/1)

Score: (3/3)

![Against global wamring](https://github.com/82817/GlobalWarmingProject/blob/master/images/4_sea_level_rising.gif)


**Audience**: This website is a commercial blog hosted by a writer. By briefing through the content of this blog, one can tell that this image is arguing against global warming. One can assume that the audience is either people who do not believe in global warming, or people who are skeptic. I'm skeptical about this chart, but I believe it does address directly to its audience (1/1)

**framework**: This chart has some confusing parts to it. It does not explain the grey shading on the left side (I'm guessing the grey are variations). In addition, the line on the right going through sea-level is also undefined. Overall, the framework confusing. (0/1)

**Story**: This chart argues that sea-level has been rising before human started to burn fossil-fuels and generate CO2. I was not able to understand the story without reading the lines below the chart. The author did a lot of unecessary work (red line on the right, arrow pointing down) just to convince the reader that sea level has been rising. All these extra work only made the reader more skeptical about the factual aspect of the chart. (0/1)

Score: (1/3)

![Human produced greenhouse gas](https://github.com/82817/GlobalWarmingProject/blob/master/images/5_greenhouse_gas.jpg)


**Audience**: This chart is made by NOAA Climate.gov. Their purpose is to promote public understanding of climate science. Their audience is the general public. I believe the chart does a good job at educating the public while keeping it simple. (1/1)

**framework**: The part that says 41% increase is not clear as to where the baseline is. Also, the y-axis have different meaning on left and right, which can add confusion to the reader. (0/1)

**Story**: After carefully reading the chart, the message I received was that increase in human-made greenhouse gas contributed to temperature anomaly. As I mentioned in the framework, the chart is not straightforward. It does a poor job at pointing out the important part and creating a story. (0.5/1)

Score: (1.5/3)


**Conclusion**: This exercise has taught me a lot on how to evaluate visualizations. I've noticed that good charts are simple and clean; the audience can easily identify the message/story of the chart. On the other hand, when the designer tried to do too much to point out a specific findings, it usually creates more confusion and tempers the integrity of the chart.
