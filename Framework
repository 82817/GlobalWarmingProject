climate change caused by human activity

In this project, we want to establish that climate change is caused by human activity. The most obvious evidence is the usage of carbon-based materials, which causes emission of carbon dioxide(CO2).  

In an article written by [Environmental Defence Fund](https://www.edf.org/climate/9-ways-we-know-humans-triggered-climate-change?utm_source=google&utm_campaign=edf_none_upd_dmt&utm_medium=cpc&utm_id=1545230990&gclid=EAIaIQobChMIzeCDw8DD4QIVUh6tBh1NsQ8tEAAYASAAEgIIivD_BwE) The research falls into nine independently studied, but physically related, lines of evidence:

Simple chemistry â€“ when we burn carbon-based materials, carbon dioxide (CO2) is emitted (research beginning in 1900s)

Basic accounting of what we burn, and therefore how much CO2 we emit (data collection beginning in 1970s)

Measuring CO2 in the atmosphere and trapped in ice to find that it's increasing, with levels higher than anything we've seen in hundreds of thousands of years (measurements beginning in 1950s)
Chemical analysis of the atmospheric CO2 that reveals the increase is coming from burning fossil fuels (research beginning in 1950s)

Basic physics that shows us that CO2 absorbs heat (research beginning in 1820s)

Monitoring climate conditions to find that recent warming of the Earth is correlated to and follows rising CO2 emissions (research beginning in 1930s)
Ruling out natural factors that can influence climate like the sun and ocean cycles (research beginning in 1830s)

Employing computer models to run experiments of natural versus human-influenced simulations of Earth (research beginning in 1960s)

Consensus among scientists who consider all previous lines of evidence and make their own conclusions (polling beginning in 1990s)
